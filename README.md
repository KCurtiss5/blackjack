# blackjack
By: Koby Curtiss

A text-only blackjack game. The game has a high-degree of cusotmization including number of decks, games before total re-shuffle, a minimum bet, custom player creation options and max players at a table. This package was meant to be utilized both as entertainment and as a learning tool. 

The game will, in the future, include AI players. However, this will take a significant amount of development effort due to the fact that there will be multiple levels of AI from beginner to "perfect".

Playing the game is rather straightforward. Just interact with the menu by typing a corresponding number and type full commands such as **hit** and **stand**.

While every dependency used is packaged with a standard python libary, you can ensure you have every dependency installed with:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

Run with python using:

        python3 blackjack.py
